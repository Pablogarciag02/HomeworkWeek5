My code consists of 3 documents
-index.html
-style.css
-script.js

The html code is changed and edited using the javascript and css.
I had to create a schedule from 9-5pm that saves the information that is added to it and saved by the button.

index.html:
Consists of 
-header
-each text area
-footer (For cleaner visual of page)
Every div contains a text area that will then be edited using javascript 


style.css
Is editing simple styling elements of the html page.

script.js
-timer
-code to change colors depending on what time it is
-code to add local storage elements into each individual text area considering the fact that it usually returns null if there is nothing in local storage.
Therefore i made it so that by default when you open the page it automatically adds a blank text into each text area so that each text area appears empty instead of displaying null.
